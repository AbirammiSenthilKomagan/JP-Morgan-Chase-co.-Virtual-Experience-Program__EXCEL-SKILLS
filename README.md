Task 1:
 The task is to use Excelâ€™s conditional formatting tools to explore and then, use the conditional formatting tools (either the menu-based tools or write your own conditional formatting formulas, whichever you prefer) to do the following explorations of the data:

        Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
        Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
        Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
        Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
        Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.

Task 2:
 Create two macros and associated buttons:

        A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth
        A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021
        
 Task 3:
  Create a simple dashboard using the account sales dataset you worked with in prior tasks
